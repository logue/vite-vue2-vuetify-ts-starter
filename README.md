# Vue 2 + TypeScript + Vite + Vuetify

This is a [starter project](https://github.com/logue/vite-vue2-ts-starter) that uses [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) as the UI framework. Please use scss version 1.32.12 due to a problem on the Vuetify side.

## Description

This template is for using Vue2 with TypeScript in Vite. Includes [vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org/) and [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/), [vue-property-decorator](https://github.com/kaorun343/vue-property-decorator).

In addition, [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/), and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) are also included and are set to be executed automatically at runtime and commit. (Since these settings are set strictly, please relax yourself.)

## Migrate from VueCli

It also works when migrating from VueCLI.

However, when importing a stylesheet with `@import`, it cannot be specified from the library directory. Must be specified from `~node_modules/`.

Also, if you used the .env file in the previous environment, you need to change the calling part from `process.env` to `import.meta.env` after installing [vite-plugin-env-compatible](https://github.com/IndexXuan/vite-plugin-env-compatible) separately.

## Troubleshooting

When adding or deleting files, an error may occur and even if the error is corrected, it may not be reflected in devserver. In that case, stop devserver and delete all the files in the `node_modules/.vite` directory. You can also run it with the `clean` command.
