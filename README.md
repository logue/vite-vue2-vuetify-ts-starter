# Vue 2 + TypeScript + Vite + Vuetify

This is a [starter project](https://github.com/logue/vite-vue2-ts-starter) that uses [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) as the UI framework. Please use scss version 1.32.12 due to a problem on the Vuetify side.

## Description

This template is for using Vue2 with TypeScript in Vite. Includes [vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org/) and [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/), [vue-property-decorator](https://github.com/kaorun343/vue-property-decorator).

In addition, [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/), and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) are also included and are set to be executed automatically at runtime and commit. (Since these settings are set strictly, please relax yourself.)

## Type Support For `.vue` Imports in TS

Since TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports, they are shimmed to be a generic Vue component type by default. In most cases this is fine if you don't really care about component prop types outside of templates. However, if you wish to get actual prop types in `.vue` imports (for example to get props validation when using manual `h(...)` calls), you can enable Volar's `.vue` type support plugin by running `Volar: Switch TS Plugin on/off` from VSCode command palette.

## Troubleshooting

When adding or deleting files, an error may occur and even if the error is corrected, it may not be reflected in devserver. In that case, stop devserver and delete all the files in the `node_modules/.vite` directory. You can also run it with the `clean` command.
